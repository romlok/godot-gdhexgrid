"""
	A converter between hex and Godot-space coordinate systems.
	
	The hex grid uses +x => NE and +y => N, whereas
	the projection to Godot-space uses +x => E, +y => S.
	
	We map hex coordinates to Godot-space with +y flipped to be the down vector
	so that it maps neatly to both Godot's 2D coordinate system, and also to
	x,z planes in 3D space.
	
	
	## Usage:
	
	#### var hex_scale = Vector2(...)

		If you want your hexes to display larger than the default 1 x 0.866 units,
		then you can customise the scale of the hexes using this property.
	
	#### func get_hex_center(hex)
	
		Returns the Godot-space Vector2 of the center of the given hex.
		
		The coordinates can be given as either a HexCell instance; a Vector3 cube
		coordinate, or a Vector2 axial coordinate.
	
	#### func get_hex_center3(hex [, y])
	
		Returns the Godot-space Vector3 of the center of the given hex.
		
		The coordinates can be given as either a HexCell instance; a Vector3 cube
		coordinate, or a Vector2 axial coordinate.
		
		If a second parameter is given, it will be used for the y value in the
		returned Vector3. Otherwise, the y value will be 0.
	
	#### func get_hex_at(coords)
	
		Returns HexCell whose grid position contains the given Godot-space coordinates.
		
		The given value can either be a Vector2 on the grid's plane
		or a Vector3, in which case its (x, z) coordinates will be used.
	
	
	### Path-finding
	
	HexGrid also includes an implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.
	The class can be used to populate an internal representation of a game grid
	with obstacles to traverse.
	
	#### func set_bounds(min_coords, max_coords)
	
		Sets the hard outer limits of the path-finding grid.
		
		The coordinates given are the min and max corners *inside* a bounding
		square (diamond in hex visualisation) region. Any hex outside that area
		is considered an impassable obstacle.
		
		The default bounds consider only the origin to be inside, so you're probably
		going to want to do something about that.
	
	#### func get_obstacles()
	
		Returns a dict of all obstacles and their costs
		
		The keys are Vector2s of the axial coordinates, the values will be the
		cost value. Zero cost means an impassable obstacle.
	
	#### func add_obstacles(coords, cost=0)
	
		Adds one or more obstacles to the path-finding grid
		
		The given coordinates (axial or cube), HexCell instance, or array thereof,
		will be added as path-finding obstacles with the given cost. A zero cost
		indicates an impassable obstacle.
	
	#### func remove_obstacles(coords)
	
		Removes one or more obstacles from the path-finding grid
		
		The given coordinates (axial or cube), HexCell instance, or array thereof,
		will be removed as obstacles from the path-finding grid.
	
	#### func get_barriers()
	
		Returns a dict of all barriers in the grid.
		
		A barrier is an edge of a hex which is either impassable, or has a
		non-zero cost to traverse. If two adjacent hexes both have barriers on
		their shared edge, their costs are summed.
		Barrier costs are in addition to the obstacle (or default) cost of
		moving to a hex.
		
		The outer dict is a mapping of axial coords to an inner barrier dict.
		The inner dict maps between HexCell.DIR_* directions and the cost of
		travel in that direction. A cost of zero indicates an impassable barrier.
	
	#### func add_barriers(coords, dirs, cost=0)
	
		Adds one or more barriers to locations on the grid.
		
		The given coordinates (axial or cube), HexCell instance, or array thereof,
		will have path-finding barriers added in the given HexCell.DIR_* directions
		with the given cost. A zero cost indicates an impassable obstacle.
		
		Existing barriers at given coordinates will not be removed, but will be
		overridden if the direction is specified.
	
	#### func remove_barriers(coords, dirs=null)
	
		Remove one or more barriers from the path-finding grid.
		
		The given coordinates (axial or cube), HexCell instance, or array thereof,
		will have the path-finding barriers in the supplied HexCell.DIR_* directions
		removed. If no direction is specified, all barriers for the given
		coordinates will be removed.
	
	#### func get_hex_cost(coords)
	
		Returns the cost of moving into the specified grid position.
		
		Will return 0 if the given grid position is inaccessible.
	
	#### func get_move_cost(coords, direction)
	
		Returns the cost of moving from one hex to an adjacent one.
		
		This method takes into account any barriers defined between the two
		hexes, as well as the cost of the target hex.
		Will return 0 if the target hex is inaccessible, or if there is an
		impassable barrier between the hexes.
		
		The direction should be provided as one of the HexCell.DIR_* values.
	
	#### func find_path(start, goal, exceptions=[])
	
		Calculates an A* path from the start to the goal.
		
		Returns a list of HexCell instances charting the path from the given start
		coordinates to the goal, including both ends of the journey.
		
		Exceptions can be specified as the third parameter, and will act as
		impassable obstacles for the purposes of this call of the function.
		This can be used for pathing around obstacles which may change position
		(eg. enemy playing pieces), without having to update the grid's list of
		obstacles every time something moves.
		
		If the goal is an impassable location, the path will terminate at the nearest
		adjacent coordinate. In this instance, the goal hex will not be included in
		the returned array.
		
		If there is no path possible to the goal, or any hex adjacent to it, an
		empty array is returned. But the algorithm will only know that once it's
		visited every tile it can reach, so try not to path to the impossible.
